The following Data Sharing Agreement applies to all individuals and organizations sharing data with the SGID in any way.

`<Four different levels of getting agreement/acknowledgement, from easiest to most onerous>`

—OR—

You accept this Data Sharing Agreement by checking the appropriate checkbox in the [Porter issue](https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues) tracking your SGID data submission.

—OR—

You must visit `<Google Form/other web-based form and response tracker>` and agree to this Data Sharing Agreement prior to creating a new [Porter issue](https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues) to submit your data to the SGID.

—OR—

You must submit a signed copy of this Data Sharing Agreement to our office prior to creating a new [Porter issue](https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues) to submit your data to the SGID.
